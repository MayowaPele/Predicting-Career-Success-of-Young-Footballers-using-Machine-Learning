âš½ Predicting the Success and Position of Young Soccer Players Using Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the overall rating of young soccer players (ages 18â€“20) based on their technical, physical, and mental attributes.
By leveraging FIFA/Football Manager-style datasets, the project applies feature selection, regression models, and a Streamlit web app to provide scouting and training insights.
